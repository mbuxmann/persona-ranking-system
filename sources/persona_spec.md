# Throxy Ideal Lead Profile

## Overview

Throxy's ideal customers are B2B companies that **sell into complex verticals**—manufacturing, education, and healthcare. These markets have long sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, and buyers who are harder to reach, making personalized outbound essential.

Within these companies, the ideal leads are individuals who are **directly accountable for pipeline generation** and **operationally involved in outbound execution**. The critical insight is that the right buyer changes dramatically based on company size—founders at startups, VPs and Directors at larger organizations.

## Lead Targeting by Company Size

### Startups (1-50 employees)

At early-stage companies, founders are operationally involved in sales and make fast purchasing decisions.

**Primary Targets:**

| Rank | Job Title | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Founder / Co-Founder | 5/5 |
| 2 | CEO / President | 5/5 |
| 3 | Owner / Co-Owner | 5/5 |
| 4 | Managing Director | 4/5 |
| 5 | Head of Sales | 4/5 |

**Buying trigger:** "I don't have time to do outbound myself anymore."

---

### SMB (51-200 employees)

Sales leadership exists but lacks resources to build sophisticated outbound infrastructure.

**Primary Targets:**

| Rank | Job Title | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | VP of Sales | 5/5 |
| 2 | Head of Sales | 5/5 |
| 3 | Sales Director | 5/5 |
| 4 | Director of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 5 | CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) | 4/5 |
| 6 | Head of Revenue Operations | 4/5 |
| 7 | VP of Growth | 4/5 |

**Buying trigger:** "My team can't keep up with our growth goals."

---

### Mid-Market (201-1,000 employees)

Established sales organizations struggling with pipeline quality and BDR productivity. Multiple stakeholders involved in decisions.

**Primary Targets:**

| Rank | Job Title | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | VP of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 2 | VP of Sales | 5/5 |
| 3 | Head of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 4 | Director of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 5 | CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) | 4/5 |
| 6 | VP of Revenue Operations | 4/5 |
| 7 | VP of GTM | 4/5 |

**Champions (for multi-threading):** Sales Managers, BDR Managers, RevOps Managers

**Buying trigger:** "We need to improve outbound efficiency and pipeline predictability."

---

### Enterprise (1,000+ employees)

Complex buying processes. CEOs are too far removed—target VP and Director level leaders who own the function.

**Primary Targets:**

| Rank | Job Title | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | VP of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 2 | VP of Inside Sales | 5/5 |
| 3 | Head of Sales Development | 5/5 |
| 4 | CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) | 4/5 |
| 5 | VP of Revenue Operations | 4/5 |
| 6 | Director of Sales Development | 4/5 |
| 7 | VP of Field Sales | 4/5 |

**Champions (essential):** BDR Managers, Directors of Sales Operations, RevOps Managers

**Buying trigger:** "We need to hit aggressive growth targets with better outbound execution."

---

## Department Priority

| Rank | Department | Relevance | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Sales Development | 5/5 | Core function Throxy supports |
| 2 | Sales | 5/5 | Owns quota, cares about pipeline |
| 3 | Revenue Operations | 4/5 | Controls process and tooling |
| 4 | Business Development | 4/5 | Often overlaps with sales dev |
| 5 | GTM / Growth | 4/5 | Strategic view of sales motion |
| 6 | Executive | 5/5 → 1/5 | Only relevant at startups |

---

## Seniority Relevance Matrix
| Seniority Level | Startup | SMB | Mid-Market | Enterprise |
|-----------------|---------|-----|------------|------------|
| Founder / Owner | 5/5 | 3/5 | 1/5 | 0/5 |
| C-Level | 5/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 | 1/5 |
| Vice President | 3/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Director | 2/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| Manager | 1/5 | 2/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 |
| Individual Contributor | 0/5 | 0/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 |

*Note: ICs (BDRs/SDRs) are not decision-makers. At Mid-Market and Enterprise, they may serve as internal champions who can refer you upward, but should not be primary targets.*

---

## Who NOT to Contact

### Hard Exclusions

| Role | Reason |
|------|--------|
| CEO / President (Mid-Market & Enterprise) | Too far removed from outbound execution |
| CFO / Finance | Wrong department |
| CTO / Engineering | No relevance to sales |
| HR / Legal / Compliance | Will slow deals or ignore outreach |
| Customer Success | Post-sale focus |
| Product Management | Different function entirely |

### Soft Exclusions

| Role | Context |
|------|---------|
| BDRs / SDRs | May feel threatened; not decision-makers |
| Account Executives | Closers, not outbound owners |
| CMO / VP Marketing | Rarely owns outbound directly |
| Board Members / Advisors | Too removed from operations |

---

## Industry Considerations

Throxy's ideal customers are companies that sell into manufacturing, education, and healthcare—not necessarily companies operating in those industries. These target verticals have complex sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, and require highly personalized outreach, which is where Throxy excels.

**Ideal Throxy customers include:**
- SaaS companies selling to hospitals, school districts, or manufacturers
- Professional services firms targeting traditional industries
- B2B technology vendors with complex, enterprise-style sales cycles
- Any company doing outbound into buyers who are harder to reach and require tailored messaging

## Qualification Signals

Beyond job title, look for these company-level and individual signals that indicate a strong fit for Throxy:

### Positive Signals (Prioritize These Leads)

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Recently raised funding | Budget available, growth mandate, pressure to scale pipeline |
| Actively hiring SDRs/BDRs | Investing in outbound, may need help scaling or supplementing |
| Sells into enterprise or mid-market buyers | Complex sales cycles that benefit from personalized outreach |
| Long sales cycles (3+ months) | Requires sophisticated, multi-touch outbound approach |
| Lead was recently promoted | Eager to make an impact, open to new approaches |
| Company posting about "pipeline problems" or "scaling sales" | Active pain awareness |
| Small or no existing SDR team | May prefer outsourcing to building in-house |
| Previous company used outsourced outbound | Familiar with the model, faster sales cycle |

### Negative Signals (Deprioritize These Leads)

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Sells to SMB or consumers (B2C) | Short sales cycles, less need for personalized outbound |
| Product-led growth (PLG) company | Outbound may not be their primary motion |
| Large, established SDR team (20+) | Likely to build in-house rather than outsource |
| Company in layoffs or cost-cutting mode | Not in buying mode |
| No online presence or outdated website | Unlikely to buy modern sales services |
| Lead has "Advisor" or "Consultant" in title | Not employed; no buying power |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Company size determines your primary target.** Founders for startups; VPs of Sales Development for SMB and up.

2. **"Sales Development" in the title = top priority** (for companies with 50+ employees).

3. **CEOs at larger companies are a waste of time.** They don't own outbound.

4. **Multi-threading is essential** at Mid-Market and Enterprise—build champions before reaching executives.

5. **Prioritize companies selling into complex verticals** (manufacturing, education, healthcare)—these buyers need Throxy's personalized approach.
